        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen. paper, or in the other media.</li>
        <li><b id="deletedtext">Css is not neccesary</b> <b id="bgcolor">CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>

    <h2 class="heading3">CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <div class="letterspace">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.<span id="bgcolor">However,in this
            tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier
            for you to try it ypurself. </li>
        </div>
    </ul>
    <p class="list">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. Id, 
        on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's Used by JavaScript.  </p>
    <p class="list">In CSS, Selectors are usetd to target a specific element or range of lements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p class="list">There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
